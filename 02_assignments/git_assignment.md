# Git Assignment

In this assignment, you will be learning more about `git` and `GitHub` by working through the questions. As you answer the questions, you will practice your git skills by staging, committing and pushing your answers (changes) along the way.

1. Create a new public repository called `git_assignment` without a `README.md`
2. Clone it to your local computer
3. Create a `README.md` and paste the following code inside:

    ```markdown
    # Git Assignment - <Your GitHub Username>
    ```

4. Stage, commit and push the repo
5. Create a new branch called `assignment`
6. In your `README.md`, answer the following questions:
    
    > a. What is an _issue_?
    It provides a way for users to keep track of bugs, tasks, fix bugs and feature request.
    > b. What is a _pull request_?
    It allows us to inform others about changes we have pushed to a branch in a repository on Git hub
    > c. How do I open up a _pull request_?
    On my account, click on Pull request,
    > d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
    In the reporitory, go to settings and under access section, click in collaborators and then click add people. Type the name of the person and click add name to repository.
    > e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?
    Git is a free open source version control tool developers install on their personal computers while Git Hub is a cloud based service built to run git.
    > f. What does `git diff` do?
    It helps us see the the changes we have made in details by comparing our working directoey to whats on our staging area
    > g. What is the `main` branch?
    It the default branch in any new repository
    > h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the `main` branch?
    

Feel free to at any point (recommended after answering every 2 questions) to stage, commit and push your work to GitHub. It is a great way to practice using `git`!

1. When you are done, please stage, commit your changes, and push it to GitHub.
2. Open up a pull request.
3. Write down in your pull request what you learned from this assignment. ([Guidelines for Pull Request Descriptions](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/blob/main/onboarding_documents/submissions.md#guidelines-for-pull-request-descriptions))

# Git Assignment

In this assignment, you will be learning more about `git` and `GitHub` by working through the questions. As you answer the questions, you will practice your git skills by staging, committing and pushing your answers (changes) along the way.

1. Create a new public repository called `git_assignment` without a `README.md`
2. Clone it to your local computer
3. Create a `README.md` and paste the following code inside:

    ```markdown
    # Git Assignment - <Your GitHub Username>
    ```

4. Stage, commit and push the repo
5. Create a new branch called `assignment`
6. In your `README.md`, answer the following questions:
    
    > a. What is an _issue_?
    
    > b. What is a _pull request_?

    > c. How do I open up a _pull request_?
    
    > d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.

    > e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?

    > f. What does `git diff` do?

    > g. What is the `main` branch?

    > h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the `main` branch?
    

Feel free to at any point (recommended after answering every 2 questions) to stage, commit and push your work to GitHub. It is a great way to practice using `git`!

1. When you are done, please stage, commit your changes, and push it to GitHub.
2. Open up a pull request and add the Learning Support staff as a reviewer. You may need to add them to your repository.
3. Write down on your pull request what you learned from this assignment. ([Guidelines for Pull Request Descriptions](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/blob/main/onboarding_documents/submissions.md#guidelines-for-pull-request-descriptions))

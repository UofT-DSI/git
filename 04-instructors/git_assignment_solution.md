# Git Assignment

In this assignment, you will be learning more about `git` and `GitHub` by working through the questions. As you answer the questions, you will practice your git skills by staging, commiting and pushing your answers (changes) along the way.

1. Create a new repository called `git_assignment` under the `UofT-DSI` GitHub organization without a `README.md`
2. Clone it to your local computer
3. Create a `README.md` and paste the following code inside:

    ```markdown
    # Git Assignment - Your GitHub name
    ```

4. Stage, commit and push the repo
5. Create a new branch calld `assignment`
6. In your `README.md`, answer the following questions:

    a. What is an issue?

    > An issue is a ticket you can create in a repository to plan, discuss and track work
    
    b. What is a pull request?

    > A pull request contains changes a user wishes to commit and merge into a branch (usually the main branch) from another branch.

    c. How do I open up a pull request?

    > You can open up a pull request on GitHub by comparing the changes. https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request
    
    d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.

    > Steps are in here: https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository

    e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?

    > Git is version control used locally on a person's computer to track changes. GitHub is a web-based platform that can host those changes and track them on the cloud.

    f. What does `git diff` do?

    > Git diff would allow users to see, compare and understand the changes in your repository.

    g. What is the `main` branch?

    > The main branch is the overarching branch where all the changes will be merged to. It can be considered containing the "latest draft" of a project.

    h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the `main` branch?

    > No! We should always create a new branch to contain our changes. As there may be more than one person working on the same repository. To avoid any unnecessary issues, it is best for everyone to create their own branches which are short-lived.g

Feel free to at any point (recommended after answering every 2 questions) to stage, commit and push your work to GitHub. It is a great way to practice using `git`!

## Submission

1. When you are done, please stage, commit your changes, and push it to GitHub.
2. Open up a pull request and add your TA as a reviewer. You may need to add them to your repository.
3. Write down on your pull request what you learned from this assignment.

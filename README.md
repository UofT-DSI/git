# Working in software teams with Git and GitHub

## Description
The first portion of this lesson will be dedicated to getting started with version control and GitHub, and how it connects to the ethical discussions of reproducibility. Learners will learn how to set up Git and initialize and utilize repositories, including recording, viewing and undoing changes. They will also learn how to create branches and collaborate with others with shared branches. This course will put it all together and introduce some more advanced commands such as de-bugging and history editing.

Throughout the entire course, students will learn how to problem solve through live coding. They will also learn about reproducibility and how to centre it within their work.

This course is designed for those who have a degree in something other than Computer Science/Statistics who are looking to enhance their data science skills for their career.

## Learning Outcomes
Students will know how to:
1. Use the Git command line
1. Preserve personal work in Git version control
1. Access and edit pervious code versions
1. Collaborate with others
1. Find and debug errors

## Expectations
The course is a live-coding class. Students are expected to follow along with the instructor-led examples. Students should be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout. Although slides will be available for students to reference, they should be referenced before or after class, as during class will be dedicated to coding with the instructor.

## Schedule
Day 1: Version Control and GitHub I (introducing version control and GitHub, basic Git commands, remote repositories)

Day 2: Version Control and GitHub II (branching, debugging, Git GUI in VSCode)

Day 3: Version Control and GitHub III (collaborating on GitHub)

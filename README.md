## Description

This module is focused on version control with Git and GitHub, and how it connects to the ethical discussions of reproducibility. Learners will set up Git and create and use repositories, including recording, viewing and undoing changes. They will also learn how to create branches and collaborate with others with shared branches. This module will also introduce some more advanced commands such as de-bugging and history editing.

Throughout the entire module, Learners will learn how to problem solve through live coding. They will also learn about reproducibility and how to centre it within their work.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, learners will:
* Use Git to collaboratively save, restore, and update work through version control
* Explain the difference between Git and GitHub

## Assignments

1. [Git Assignment](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/git/blob/main/02_assignments/git_assignment.md)

## Module Contacts

**Questions can be submitted to the #questions channel on Slack**

* Technical Facilitator: **{Name}** {Pronouns}. Emails to the Technical Facilitator can be sent to {first_name.last_name}@mail.utoronto.ca.
* Learning Support Staff: **{Name}** {Pronouns}. Emails to the Learning Support can be sent to {first_name.last_name}@mail.utoronto.ca.
 
## Delivery of Module

The module will run sychronously twice a week on Zoom. The first two days are used as "lectures" and will last a maximum of 3 hours. During this time, the Technical Facilitator will introduce the concepts for the week. The last two days are used for as optional, asychronous work periods. The work periods will also last for up to 3 hours. During these two days, an Technical Facilitator or Learning Support will be present on Zoom to assist learners reach the intended learning outcomes.

### How the Technical Facilitator will deliver

The Technical Facilitator will introduce the concepts through a collaborative demonstration along with the use of the slides.
 
### Expectations

Learners are encouraged to be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout the module.

## Schedule

The schedule is tentative and may be modified as needed. Learners will be notified of schedule changes.

||Day 1|Day 2|Day 3|Day 4|Day 5|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Week 1|Lecture 1 ([Shell](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/shell))|Lecture 2 (Shell)|Lecture 3 (Git & Github)|Work Period 1|Work Period 2|

 
## Policies

* **Accessibility:** We want to provide an accessible learning environment for all. If there is something we can do to make this Module more accessible to you, please let us know.
* **Module communications:** Communications take place over email or on Slack. If communicating over email, please include "DSI-Git" or similar in the subject line, e.g. "DSI-Git: pandas question"
* **Camera:** Keeping your camera on is optional.
* **Microphone:** Please keep microphones muted unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking as some Zoom configurations make it hard to tell who is talking!
* **Assessment:** There will be homework which **is not** graded, but highly recommended, and there will be two assignments which **are** graded.
 
## Requirements

* Learners are not expected to have any coding experience, we designed the learning contents for beginners.
* Learners are encouraged to ask questions, and collaborate with others to enhance learning.
* Learners must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Learners must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code in order to complete assignments. It should be use as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
* We expect learners to have completed the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/Onboarding/tree/tech-onboarding-docs).
* Camera is optional although highly encouraged. We understand that not everyone may have the space at home to have the camera on.

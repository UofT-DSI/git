# **Unix Shell Homework**
```console
$ echo "Data Sciences Institute"
$ echo "by: Rachael Lam"
```

##### **Expectations**
The goal of this homework is to give students an opportunity to practice what was learned during each class. This will help students remember the content and prepare for the next class.

Because each class builds upon the last, it's important to review the content and become comfortable with it, as time is too limited for a full in-class review.

## `Day 2`

---
##### **Prompt:**
Clone a repo of your choice from GitHub. Save the first 10 instances of `git log` to a txt file. Please include the commentor name, relative date and subject. Then add a test file, commit the test file and push it to the remote repo. This test file does not have to have anything to do with the project itself - just to practice the git process.

**To submit:**
    1. A screenshot of your terminal commands
    2. txt file of `git log`

**Due:** Thursday, Feb 16th
